Most of the code is based on the following python libraries:
 - numpy
 - numba
 - matplotlib
 
To run experiments, look at the notebooks folder, that is based on:
 - jupyter-notebook

For ranking, we used the following lp solver library:
 - cplex

To load LIBSVM files, more precisely to read libsvm files format we used:
 - scikit-learn
 
To load MULAN files, more precisely to read mulan files format we used:
 - arff
 - skmultilearn

Dataset can be download at:
 - LIBSVM: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/oldfiles/index-1.0.html
 - MULAN: http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html

Change path in config file dataloader/config.py to specify path to your data.
